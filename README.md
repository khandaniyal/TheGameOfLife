**Summary and description of what was done until the day of delivery.**
--

At the beginning of the first sprint we were quite unaware of how to use JSwing so we had to fend by ourselves and try to gather all the necessary information to start the project. However almost two weeks into the project we had a **``RAW``** prototype and it was working just fine. Therefore we decided to refactor the **``RAW``** prototype all we could and individually, we had some problems and we still have, so we made a more advanced **``RAW``** protoype to deliver for the dead end of our first sprint.


**Technologies and used lenguages**
--
The technologies used for this project have been **``JSwing``** and the programming language as expected has been the almighty **``Java``**. For the IDE's almost all the memeber of the group have been using **``Eclipse``** except for one of our members whch has been unsig **``Intellij IDEA``**.

**What goals we had for delivery. Product backlog items**
--

Our goal was to have a prototype which can at least load a stage/scene and work just fine. We have done all the **``priority 1``** features and one **``priority 5``** features.

**Which we have achieved and which have remained pending**
--

All of the **``priorities 1``** and one **``priority 5``** but we will be adding more as the project goes on.

**What difficulties we have encountered and how we have solved them**
--

We have encountered some issues when interacting with **``Jswing``** and we still have but with the help from our group mates we have been trying to solve them. We have been using dev webistes such as **``StackOverflow``** and many more. 


**How we have organized ourselves internally**
--

With the help of **``Trello``** we have been assigning each member a role. Not to mention some of us had some agreements or commitments to do regarding our interaction between oursleves. Somone said to improve his social interacion/skills and try to talk with different members of the team which I am quite suprised beacuse he actually did, so props to him.
